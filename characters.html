            Do you remember our first meet?I
was making our group in Bangla. 
I knew about everyone but did not knew roll 35 Mehejabin.I went up to her and was amazed by her beauty. 
Everyone is beautiful. But she was a bit different.
 I don't know if anyone said it or not but Adhora your eyes are as beautiful as the shining moon.It is very beautiful.
It caught my eye for a long time.

            This is a weird word. It's not like temperature but a personality.
Everyone in our class has different personalities. 
I never found anyone or even used this word.
But Adhora was different. Everything she did made me think, 'How In The World is she this Cool!'
Thats way, I also think you are cooler than most boys and girls in our class.

            a.k.a not temperature. 
You know about aura right? Everyone has some kind of aura around them.
Some are good and some may be scary. But 
I think your aura is full of warmness. I have to admit when I came near you I felt a bit happy.
It feels nice.Others are also warm but in case of all sisters, you are the most warmful.

             Let's be honest together. Our whole class is created with extrovert personalities. And it may seem not like it but I am an introvert.
I really sometimes hate when there is too much people or disturbance or even just talk.
I am not sure but I have seen you alone a lot.
Which made me think about myself more. There could be a lot of reasons but I think it's ok. Don't be ashamed if you have that sort of feelings. As you have another idiot (me) who is not same but closer and mony more.

          Adhore you sometimes are interesting.It is not easy to find someone interesting but I guess i found yours.This is really a weird one.Main thing is you are easy to talk and doesn't take simple matter or simple talk to whole another level
          (you know what i am talking about)

             Most in communication, we are required to listen to the speaker.But I noticed sometimes you didn't fully give them the attention.
Adhora pls be careful of this.You could lose friends if you are not attentive.
As a human always wants attention.'

             You know, Adhora it's very hard to trust others. Everybody can say so many things in mind or body. Thinking as if you were a worker to them.
It's just my mindsets. I think I am also weak in this part and you could be as well.
It's all into your environment. No one is weak but the environment made them so.
